{"name":"Mobile-status-change","tagline":"Android - Control mobile data and wifi status using command prompt.","body":"Recently I have faced one issue, My phone got locked it's \"too many pattern attempts\" on lock screen and my mobile data + wi-fi were disabled. An internet connection was needed to pass that lock screen.\r\n\r\nSo I was on a mission to start my phone's internet connection using any method I can.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I looked into adb commands, So there are shell commands available to control your mobile data and wi-fi status.\r\n\r\nTo enable/disable wifi:\r\n$ adb shell svc wifi enable \r\n$ adb shell svc wifi disable\r\nTo enable/disable mobile data:\r\n$ adb shell svc data enable \r\n$ adb shell svc data disable \r\n\r\nWI-Fi things work for me, but unfortunately I was not able to control mobile data (I am using HTC device, May be all HTC has same issue). And internet connection was needed to unlock my phone. So I wrote one application which receives the broadcast. \r\n\r\nHere is a play store link.\r\n\r\nYou can also download APK\r\n\r\nNow, How to control mobile data. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf above application was not installed into device install,  Download and Install it using adb command. adb install <-- apk location -->\r\nYou need to send broadcast from command prompt using adb commands listed below:\r\n\r\n$ adb shell am broadcast -a yp.data.handlebroadcast -n yp.data.handle/.DataChangeReceiver --ez \"wifiEnable\" \"true\" --ez \"mobileDataEnable\" \"true\"\r\nSo there you go. You can change wifiEnable and mobileDataEnable value accordingly. This command will send a broadcast to installed application and application will do the rest of the work.\r\n\r\nHere is some reference links:\r\nHow to install and Use ADB\r\nhttp://adbshell.com/\r\nAdb debug bridge\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
