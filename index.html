          <p>Recently I have faced one issue, My phone got locked it's "too many pattern attempts" on lock screen and my mobile data + wi-fi were disabled. An internet connection was needed to pass that lock screen.</p>

<p>So I was on a mission to start my phone's internet connection using any method I can.</p>

<p>Firstly, I looked into adb commands, So there are shell commands available to control your mobile data and wi-fi status.</p>

<p>To enable/disable wifi:
$ adb shell svc wifi enable 
$ adb shell svc wifi disable
To enable/disable mobile data:
$ adb shell svc data enable 
$ adb shell svc data disable </p>

<p>WI-Fi things work for me, but unfortunately I was not able to control mobile data (I am using HTC device, May be all HTC has same issue). And internet connection was needed to unlock my phone. So I wrote one application which receives the broadcast. </p>

<p>Here is a play store link.</p>

<p>You can also download APK</p>

<p>Now, How to control mobile data. </p>

<p>If above application was not installed into device install,  Download and Install it using adb command. adb install &lt;-- apk location --&gt;
You need to send broadcast from command prompt using adb commands listed below:</p>

<p>$ adb shell am broadcast -a yp.data.handlebroadcast -n yp.data.handle/.DataChangeReceiver --ez "wifiEnable" "true" --ez "mobileDataEnable" "true"
So there you go. You can change wifiEnable and mobileDataEnable value accordingly. This command will send a broadcast to installed application and application will do the rest of the work.</p>
